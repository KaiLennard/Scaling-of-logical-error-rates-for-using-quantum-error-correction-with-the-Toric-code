# Scaling-of-logical-error-rates-for-using-quantum-error-correction-with-the-Toric-code
Simulation of an MWPM decoder computing the logical error rates of a Toric code using varying error rates among the qubits

This program was used to create the results of the Master thesis: "Scaling of logical error rates for using quantum error correction with the Toric code".

It investigates the effect of varying error rates amon the qubits of a Toric code. Here, a step function and a truncated Gaussian function are chosen to distribute error rates in order to study and compare logical error rates.
