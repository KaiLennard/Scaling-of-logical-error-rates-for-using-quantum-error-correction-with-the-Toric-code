# Scaling-of-logical-error-rates-for-using-quantum-error-correction-with-the-Toric-code
Simulation of an MWPM decoder computing the logical error rates of a Toric code using varying error rates among the qubits

This program was used to create the results of the Master thesis: "Scaling of logical error rates for using quantum error correction with the Toric code"
It investigates the effect of varying error rates on qubits within the Toric code.
